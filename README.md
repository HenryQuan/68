It displays current battery percentage on your IOS devices.
It displays current battery capacity on your Android devices.
It generates battery report on you Windows devices (with a battery).

### Backstory for IOS
Recently, I got an iPod Touch from my friend and it could not display battery percentage on the status bar. 
This app is only created because of that. I hope Apple could just add it because it is not that complicated but they choose not to.

### Backstory for Android and Windows
IOS has a build-in battery health so Android and Windows should also have one.

## Mac version??
Maybe install Windows 10 with bootcamp and then use the windows program.
