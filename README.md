## Android
- OnePlus 5
- Pocophone

x means it does not work. This app might be available on Google Play soon.

### Backstory for IOS
Recently, I got an iPod Touch from my friend and it could not display battery percentage on the status bar. 
This app is only created because of that. I hope Apple could just add it because it is not that complicated but they choose not to.

### Backstory for Android and Windows
IOS has a build-in battery health so Android and Windows should also have one.

## Mac
~~Maybe install Windows 10 with bootcamp and then use the windows program.~~
Mac OS doesn't even tell you how much time remaining. That's why I have to write one by myself.
