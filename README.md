It displays current battery percentage on your IOS devices.

It displays current battery capacity on your Android devices.

It generates battery report on you Windows devices (with a battery).

## Android
- OnePlus 5
- Pocophone
- Huawei Mate 10 (x)

x means it does not work. This app might be available on Google Play soon.

### Backstory for IOS
Recently, I got an iPod Touch from my friend and it could not display battery percentage on the status bar. 
This app is only created because of that. I hope Apple could just add it because it is not that complicated but they choose not to.

### Backstory for Android and Windows
IOS has a build-in battery health so Android and Windows should also have one.

## Mac Version??
Maybe install Windows 10 with bootcamp and then use the windows program.
