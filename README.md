## Android
x means `doesn't work at all` and o means `partially` working. This app might not work on all devices.
- OnePlus 5
- Pocophone
- Huawei Mate 10 (x)
- Samsung A70 (o)

## iOS
Recently, I got an iPod Touch from my friend but it could not display battery percentage on the status bar. 
This app is only created because of that. 
I hope Apple could just add it because it is not that complicated but they choose not to. 
This is still the case now and a bit more features will be added later or never.


### Backstory for Android and Windows
IOS has a build-in battery health so Android and Windows should also have something similar.

## Mac
~~Maybe install Windows 10 with bootcamp and then use the windows program.~~
Mac OS doesn't even tell you how much time remaining. That's why I have to write one by myself.
